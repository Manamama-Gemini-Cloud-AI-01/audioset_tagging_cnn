# Lessons in Satisficing: A Methodology for Amorphous IT Problems

This document outlines the lessons learned from a successful collaboration to solve a complex video generation task. The problem was "amorphous": the final goal was clear, but the technical path to achieving it was unknown and fraught with unforeseen challenges. 

The successful methodology was a hybrid approach, blending upfront planning with agile, feedback-driven execution, which could be described as **Hypothesis-Driven Development with Live Feedback**.

## Core Principles of the Methodology

The core philosophy is that for complex, novel problems, the initial plan is not a contract but a starting hypothesis. The goal is not to create a perfect plan but to create a "good enough" plan that allows for the first experiment. The proof of the pudding is in the eating.

1.  **Start with a "Good Enough" Hypothesis (The Plan):**
    *   Begin by documenting the problem and a logical, high-level implementation plan. This is crucial for establishing a shared understanding and a clear starting direction.
    *   However, treat this plan with healthy skepticism. Acknowledge from the outset that it is based on incomplete information and is likely to be flawed ("best plans of mice and men often go awry"). Its primary value is in enabling the first testable prototype.

2.  **Prioritize Experiments Over Theory:**
    *   The fastest way to uncover a plan's flaws is to execute it. Running the code, even if it's expected to fail, provides real-world data that is more valuable than any amount of theoretical debate about potential outcomes.
    *   The core loop is: **Plan -> Prototype -> Test (Run) -> Get Feedback -> Analyze -> Refine or Pivot.**

3.  **Treat All Failures as Data:**
    *   A failed run is not a waste of time; it is a successful experiment that has generated invaluable data. Our journey had several key "productive failures":
        *   **The "Cacophony" Video:** This experiment falsified our initial hypothesis (scene-based concatenation) by revealing the "unstable canvas" problem with `matplotlib`. This failure saved us from investing more time in a dead-end approach.
        *   **The OOM Crash:** This experiment revealed a critical memory leak in an alternative approach, which, upon investigation, led to a profound insight about `moviepy` generators vs. list comprehensions.

4.  **Leverage External Scaffolding and Pivots:**
    *   Do not be afraid to abandon a failing hypothesis and pivot to a new one, even if it comes from an external source. 
    *   Introducing Grok AI's flawed code was a critical turning point. Instead of starting from scratch, we used it as a "scaffold," saving time and allowing us to focus on fixing its specific (and educational) flaws.

## Lessons for the AI Partner

*   **Trust Human-Centric Feedback:** Qualitative descriptions like "it gives me a headache" or "it looks like a 1950s TV" are high-priority data. They often point to the true nature of a bug more effectively than a simple error log.
*   **When Stuck, Simplify:** When faced with a complex failure, the most effective strategy is to strip the code back to a last known-good state and re-introduce complexity one piece at a time. This isolates the variable causing the problem.
*   **Don't Assume, Verify:** Do not assume a file exists or a process worked just because the command returned `exit code 0`. Always verify the actual output (or lack thereof) before proceeding.
*   **Embrace Pivots:** Be ready to discard a failing plan and enthusiastically adopt a new one based on experimental results. The goal is the solution, not defending the initial plan.

## Lessons for the Human Partner

*   **Guide the Experiment:** Act as the lead researcher. Provide clear, focused instructions for testing, such as "run it on the smaller file" or "examine the frame at this specific timestamp." This directs the AI's powerful but sometimes unfocused execution capabilities.
*   **Provide Rich, Descriptive Feedback:** The more descriptive the feedback on a visual or behavioral bug, the better. The AI can parse technical logs, but it needs the human eye to interpret the *quality* of the result.
*   **Introduce Alternative Scaffolds:** If one approach is failing, introducing alternative codebases or ideas (like Grok's script) can provide the breakthrough needed to escape a local maximum and find a better solution path.
*   **Maintain the Plan/Execute Balance:** The initial act of co-writing the problem statement and implementation plan was essential for alignment. The willingness to immediately deviate from it based on new data was essential for success.
